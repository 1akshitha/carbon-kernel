    <!--
       The membership scheme used in this setup. The only values supported at the moment are
       "multicast" and "wka"

       1. multicast - membership is automatically discovered using multicasting
       2. wka - Well-Known Address based multicasting. Membership is discovered with the help
                of one or more nodes running at a Well-Known Address. New members joining a
                cluster will first connect to a well-known node, register with the well-known node
                and get the membership list from it. When new members join, one of the well-known
                nodes will notify the others in the group. When a member leaves the cluster or
                is deemed to have left the cluster, it will be detected by the Group Membership
                Service (GMS) using a TCP ping mechanism.
